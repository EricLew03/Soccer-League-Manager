# Soccer League Tracker

## What will this application do?
This application will allow you to track all the matches in a soccer league in three ways :

* ***Match-wise***; it will record the match score and the scorers.

* ***Team-wise***; the application can produce the match history of a specific team you are interested.

* ***League-wise***; the application will produce the standings of all the teams according to the recorded match scores,
where a win will result in 3 points, a draw 1 point, and a loss 0 points. In addition, it will also display the W-D-L record of teams for the season to know how the team is performing.


### Who will use it?
Soccer league organizers can keep track of all the matches that are happening in the
league and update the league standing accordingly.

### Why is this project of interest to me?
In high school, I was part of the soccer team, where we would play weekly in the school league. The match scores and
other stats were all recorded on paper.

The pen and paper method was  adequate in the short-term but as
more games were played, this method was **error-prone** as some match records
were lost, and **updating the league standing was challenging**.
